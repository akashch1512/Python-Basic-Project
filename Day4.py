**Improvements:**

* **Dictionary Structure:** 
   * Instead of using the user's name as the key, consider using a unique ID or simply `book` as the key. This makes it easier to store multiple books later if needed.
   * The current value is a long string.  A better approach is to have a nested dictionary structure:
    ```python
   book_info = {
       'book': {
           'title': Book_Name,
           'author': Book_Authour
       },
       'user_name': User_Name
   }
   ```
   This way, you can access individual details more easily (e.g., `book_info['book']['title']`).

* **f-Strings (Formatting):**  While f-strings are great, they're not necessary here. You can simply concatenate strings:
    ```python
    print(Book_Name + " is Fav Book Of User " + User_Name + " And Author of Book is " + Book_Authour)
    ```
* **Error Handling:**  Currently, there's no error handling for cases like the user entering invalid data.

**Refactored Code:**

```python
def store_book():
    user_name = input("Enter Your Name: ")
    book_name = input("Enter Name Of Your Fav Book: ")
    book_author = input("Enter Book Author Name: ")

    book_info = {
        'book': {
            'title': book_name,
            'author': book_author
        },
        'user_name': user_name
    }
    
    print(f"{book_info['book']['title']} is the favorite book of {book_info['user_name']}.")

store_book()
```
**Explanation of Changes:**
 * The function name is now lowercase with underscores for better readability.
 * The dictionary now stores data in a more meaningful and structured way
 * The code now prints the information in a more readable way using f-strings



**Additional Tips:**

* **Function Naming Conventions:** Follow Python conventions by using lowercase with underscores for function names.
* **String Formatting:**  Consider f-strings for more concise string formatting.
* **Error Handling:**  Add `try-except` blocks to handle potential errors (e.g., if the user doesn't enter any input).
