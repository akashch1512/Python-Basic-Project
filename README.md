# 100 Days of Code: Python Basics

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is a collection of small, daily projects I'm building to master the fundamentals of Python programming. Each project is a stepping stone towards becoming a proficient Python developer.

## Projects

* **Day 1:** Number Guessing Game - Test your luck and see if you can guess the secret number!
* **Day 2:** Choose Your Own Adventure - Embark on an interactive story where your decisions shape the outcome.
* **Day 3:** Password Generator - Create strong, random passwords to keep your accounts secure.
